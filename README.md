### Functionality

- Create a 16x16 grid of square divs
- Create the divs using JavaScript. Don’t try making them by hand with copy and pasting in your HTML file!
- It’s best to put your grid squares inside another “container” div (which can go directly in your HTML).
- There are several different ways to make the divs appear as a grid (versus just one on each line). Feel free to use any or play with each of them:
